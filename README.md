angular-prism
=============

Angular bindings for [Prism.js](http://prismjs.com).

Tested with Angular 5+.


## Open question

How do I allow the uses of my package to specify which plugins they want from Prism?

Or do I include them all and the minifiers within webpack will minify what you don't use?
